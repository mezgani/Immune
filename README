who provides detailed assessments clients for an entire security infrastructures to identify, manage and eliminate any 
vulnerability and failure on extended exponentiel networks.

IUTMS is an advanced centralized solutions and configurations for a distributed environments, where you can deploy sets 
of configurations instances over master and slave NOCs.

Native LABS’s UTM is hosted on Native LABs data centers, where we keep on your network, and could help your administrators and 
engineers to monitor the infrastructure and solve many issues.

Native LABS provide two kinds of clients agent appliance over MIPS architecture and light programs that you can host on your data center.
The Native LABS’s UTM core is an automatos developed with C and Python, that’s based on a modular architecture.
